"""Lock that every workflow job has a sensible `timeout-minutes` bound.

Companion to `test_workflows_yaml_parseable.py` (this repo's earlier
propagation of `portfolio-ops#30` / `#31`) — same silent-rot prevention
arc, different failure mode.

The failure mode this catches: GitHub Actions defaults to 360 minutes
(6 hours) per job when no `timeout-minutes` is set. A hung job — network
stall during `pip install`, infinite loop in a asyncio TaskGroup test, stuck
embedding-API call — therefore burns the full 6-hour ceiling before the
runner kills it. That's quota the operator pays for whether the run
produced anything or not.

`llm-eval-harness` shipped the canonical first hop in PR #63;
`rag-production-kit` is the second propagation hop (#55). This file is
the next hop for `python-async-llm-pipelines` per issue #50. Policy band
[1, 30] matches; every job here lands at 15 since none of the current
workloads (pure-python asyncio TaskGroup tests, ruff, memory-file existence
checks) approach that ceiling.

Spec / origin: this repo's #50.
