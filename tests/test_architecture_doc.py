"""Architecture-doc lock: catch drift between `docs/architecture.md` and
the actual shipped surface of the repo.

Sister to the architecture-doc locks shipped this same week in
``embedding-model-shootout`` (PR #20), ``vector-search-at-scale``
(PR #22), ``llm-eval-harness`` (PR #30), ``prompt-regression-suite``
(PR #25), ``llm-cost-optimizer`` (PR #28), ``rag-production-kit``
(PR #30), and ``chunking-strategies-lab`` (PR #22), plus the JS
variants.

This doc uses BOTH ``(#NN)`` issue references AND ``D-NNN`` core-decision
references, so coverage is dual-axis (compare:
``chunking-strategies-lab`` PR #22 D-NNN-only;
``embedding-model-shootout`` PR #20 #NN-only).

Four invariants pinned:

1. **Path-token reachability.** Every backtick-quoted token starting with
   one of ``RESOLVABLE_PREFIXES`` resolves on disk. Operator-supplied
   future artifacts allow-listed in ``OPERATOR_SUPPLIED_PATHS``.
   Placeholder shapes ``<...>``, ``{...}``, glob ``*`` skipped.

2. **Closed-feature-issue coverage.** Every issue in
   ``KNOWN_SHIPPED_ISSUES`` referenced at least once.

3. **Active-decision coverage.** Every non-superseded ``D-NNN >= 2`` in
   ``MEMORY/core_decisions_ai.md`` referenced at least once.

4. **Banned-phrase absence.**

Hard-pin tests lock each constant.
