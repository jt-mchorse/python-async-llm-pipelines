## 2026-05-14 — Issue #1: async batching with bounded concurrency
**Duration:** ~45 min · **Branch:** `session/2026-05-14-1445-issue-01`

- Shipped `async_pipelines.process(items, fn, *, concurrency, return_exceptions=False)` — `asyncio.TaskGroup` + `asyncio.Semaphore`-bounded fan-out, results returned in input order (D-003).
- Shipped `async_pipelines.stream(producer, fn, *, concurrency, queue_size, return_exceptions=False)` — bounded `asyncio.Queue` for backpressure on unbounded async sources.
- Wrapper is runtime-dep-free (D-002): only stdlib `asyncio`. Anthropic/OpenAI/httpx are not required deps.
- 16 tests, 97% coverage. Covers ordering, concurrency-ceiling enforcement via semaphore measurement, fail-fast cancellation propagation through TaskGroup, partial-failure mode, backpressure on the bounded queue.
- README backfilled with real Quickstart (10-line runnable `process()` snippet + a streaming snippet).
- D-002 (runtime-dep-free) and D-003 (input-order results) recorded in MEMORY (separate `memory:` commit).

**Why this work, this session:** Issue #1 is the foundation for #2 (concurrent tool dispatch) and #4 (1000-doc benchmark). The wrapper has to exist before there's anything to benchmark.

**Open questions / blockers:** The 5–20× win benchmark (#4) needs a real LLM-call workload — deferred until either the Anthropic SDK adapter or a swappable provider interface is in place.

**Next session:** Issue #2 (concurrent tool-call dispatch) — sits cleanly on top of the `process()` shape shipped here.

## 2026-05-15 — Issue #2: Concurrent tool-call dispatch
**Duration:** ~60 min · **Branch:** `session/2026-05-15-1923-issue-02`

- Shipped `async_pipelines/tool_dispatch.py`: `ToolCall`/`ToolResult` dataclasses, `ToolRegistry` (thin dict wrapper, D-004), `dispatch_tool_calls()` with `asyncio.TaskGroup` + optional `Semaphore`, partial-failure tolerance via `return_exceptions`, fail-fast wrapped in `PipelineError` (parity with `process()`, D-006), per-tool telemetry on `elapsed_ms`.
- `ToolResult` carries `tool_call_id` (D-005) so callers round-trip Anthropic `tool_use_id`s without maintaining a side correlation map.
- Missing-tool error surface: pre-resolved up-front in fail-fast mode (clean error early), recorded on the result in `return_exceptions=True` mode.
- 17 new hermetic tests + 16 from #1 = 33/33 passing. Acceptance criteria from #2 all met (handles 1..K calls, partial failures don't poison batch, 5-tool serial-vs-concurrent bench in suite).
- README "Tool dispatch (#2 · this PR)" section with snippets.

**Why this work, this session:** Tool dispatch is the natural sibling to `process()` — both are bounded-concurrency fan-outs over independent units of work. Sharing `PipelineError` and the `return_exceptions` semantic keeps the package's mental model consistent. The `ToolCall`/`ToolResult` shape is what `agent-orchestration-platform`'s tool registry (#2 there) will consume.

**Open questions / blockers:** None. Real production-workload speedup (5–20×) still pending #4's 1000-doc benchmark with a real LLM-call workload; the test-suite bench shows the speedup mechanism is real on a deterministic fake.

**Next session:** Issue #4 (1000-doc benchmark) is the natural sibling — uses both `process` and `dispatch_tool_calls` against a real-shape (mock-LLM) workload to publish numbers for `docs/benchmarks.md`.
