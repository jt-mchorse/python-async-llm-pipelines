"""Bounded-concurrency primitives for LLM-style async workloads.

Both primitives are built on stdlib ``asyncio`` with no third-party deps
and target Python 3.11+ (``asyncio.TaskGroup``).

``process(items, fn, *, concurrency)`` — fan out a finite list through
``fn``, capped at ``concurrency`` simultaneous in-flight calls, results
returned in the input order. By default a failing ``fn`` cancels the
batch (TaskGroup semantics); pass ``return_exceptions=True`` to keep
going and collect exceptions in-line.

``stream(producer, fn, *, concurrency, queue_size)`` — same fan-out
shape but driven off an unbounded async source, with the queue size
providing backpressure to the producer.

    a live (but not atomically consistent across fields) snapshot.

    Fields:
        produced: number of items pulled from the producer.
        consumed: number of items finished by ``fn`` (success or
            exception when ``return_exceptions=True``).

            space (the backpressure signal — non-zero means the producer
            was slower than the consumer pool).
        max_queue_depth: high-water mark of items sitting in the queue.
        producer_pause_seconds: cumulative wall time the producer spent
            blocked on a full queue.
