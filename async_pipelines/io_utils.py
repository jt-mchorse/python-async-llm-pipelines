"""Atomic on-disk write helper.

The benchmark scripts in `scripts/` write artifacts (markdown rendered
into the README's "Benchmark Results" section, plus companion JSON
consumed by downstream plotting/aggregation tooling). `Path.write_text`
is not atomic: SIGINT/SIGTERM/disk-full/OOM between the implicit
`open(..., "w")` truncate and `close()` flush leaves the destination
zero-length or partial.

`atomic_write_text` writes to a sibling temp file in the destination's
parent directory, `fsync`s, then `os.replace`s. Same-directory
placement is load-bearing: it guarantees the rename is same-filesystem
so the POSIX rename can't fall back to a copy.

Pattern mirrors the portfolio siblings:
- `rag_kit/io_utils.atomic_write_text` (rag-production-kit#44/#45)
- `eval_harness/io_utils.atomic_write_text` (llm-eval-harness#51, D-015)
- `emb_shootout/io_utils.atomic_write_text` (embedding-model-shootout#37, D-009)
- `prompt_regression/io.atomic_write_text` (prompt-regression-suite#40)

# Cap the target basename's contribution to the temp filename. The temp name is
# `.<base>.<random>.tmp`; the affixes add ~13-20 bytes, so prepending a full
# basename that is itself near NAME_MAX (255 on ext4/APFS) overflows the limit
# and the write fails with `OSError: [Errno 63] File name too long` — even though
# a plain `Path.write_text` of that same target succeeds (sibling of
# rag-production-kit#128 and mcp-server-cookbook#96). The base in the temp name
# is cosmetic (`ls`-ability); uniqueness comes from `NamedTemporaryFile`'s random
# component, so truncating it is safe. Budget is in BYTES (NAME_MAX is a byte
# limit) and we trim on a char boundary so multibyte names are never split
# mid-codepoint.

    """Length of *base* in the bytes the filesystem actually sees.

    `os.fsencode`, not `base.encode("utf-8")` (#104). Both halves of the
    comment above are true and the old implementation still counted the wrong
    bytes: NAME_MAX limits the bytes handed to the kernel, which is
    `os.fsencode` — `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` together with
    `sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors()`, i.e. `surrogateescape` on POSIX.

    That handler is why the distinction bites rather than being pedantry. A
    path byte that is not valid UTF-8 arrives in Python as a lone surrogate in
    `U+DC80..U+DCFF`, and strict `str.encode("utf-8")` refuses to encode it —
    so `_cap_base_for_temp` used to raise `UnicodeEncodeError` on a destination
    the OS can name, *before* reaching the length question. `sys.argv` decodes
    with the same handler, so `--out $'bench\\xff.md'` is enough.

    `UnicodeEncodeError` is a `ValueError`, so neither bench script's
    `except OSError` guard caught it — and both guards exist to prevent exactly
    what it produced. `bench_1000_doc.py`: "Without this guard it escaped
    `amain` as a raw traceback at exit 1 — the 'success' range — *after* the
    benchmark already ran". `bench_backpressure.py` carries the mirrored
    comment for `--out-md` / `--out-json`. Measured, both exited 1 with a
    traceback on a name carrying one non-UTF-8 byte.
    `benchmark.dump_benchmark_json` is library-public and calls
    `atomic_write_text` bare, so an embedding caller written against the
    `OSError` a plain `Path.write_text` of that target raises was exposed too.

    `os.fsencode` never raises: `surrogateescape` on POSIX, `surrogatepass` on
    Windows, so every `str` a `Path` can hold round-trips. For a name that is
    valid UTF-8 it returns exactly the old number, so the budget is unchanged
    for every name that worked before.
