"""Atomic on-disk write helper.

The benchmark scripts in `scripts/` write artifacts (markdown rendered
into the README's "Benchmark Results" section, plus companion JSON
consumed by downstream plotting/aggregation tooling). `Path.write_text`
is not atomic: SIGINT/SIGTERM/disk-full/OOM between the implicit
`open(..., "w")` truncate and `close()` flush leaves the destination
zero-length or partial.

`atomic_write_text` writes to a sibling temp file in the destination's
parent directory, `fsync`s, then `os.replace`s. Same-directory
placement is load-bearing: it guarantees the rename is same-filesystem
so the POSIX rename can't fall back to a copy.

Pattern mirrors the portfolio siblings:
- `rag_kit/io_utils.atomic_write_text` (rag-production-kit#44/#45)
- `eval_harness/io_utils.atomic_write_text` (llm-eval-harness#51, D-015)
- `emb_shootout/io_utils.atomic_write_text` (embedding-model-shootout#37, D-009)
- `prompt_regression/io.atomic_write_text` (prompt-regression-suite#40)

# basename that is itself near NAME_MAX (255 on ext4/APFS) overflows the limit
# and the write fails with `OSError: [Errno 63] File name too long` — even though
# a plain `Path.write_text` of that same target succeeds (sibling of
# rag-production-kit#128 and mcp-server-cookbook#96). The base in the temp name
# is cosmetic (`ls`-ability); uniqueness comes from `NamedTemporaryFile`'s random
# component, so truncating it is safe. Budget is in BYTES (NAME_MAX is a byte
# limit) and we trim on a char boundary so multibyte names are never split
